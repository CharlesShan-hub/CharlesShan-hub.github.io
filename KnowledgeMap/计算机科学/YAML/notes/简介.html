This specification is both an introduction to the YAML language and the concepts supporting it. It is also a complete specification of the information needed to develop </span><a href='https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#processes-and-models'><span>applications</span></a><span> for processing YAML.</span></em></p><ul><li><span>YAML缩写自YAML Ain’t Markup Language，是一种数据序列化语言。</span></li></ul><ul><li><span>它被设计成对人类友好的，并且可以与现代编程语言很好地处理常见的日常任务。</span></li></ul><p><em><span>Open, interoperable and readily understandable tools have advanced computing immensely. YAML was designed from the start to be useful and friendly to people working with data. It uses Unicode </span><a href='https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#character-set'><span>printable</span></a><span> characters, </span><a href='https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#indicator-characters'><span>some</span></a><span> of which provide structural information and the rest containing the data itself. YAML achieves a unique cleanness by minimizing the amount of structural characters and allowing the data to show itself in a natural and meaningful way. For example, </span><a href='https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#indentation-spaces'><span>indentation</span></a><span> may be used for structure, </span><a href='https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#flow-mappings'><span>colons</span></a><span> separate </span><a href='https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#mapping'><span>key/value pairs</span></a><span> and </span><a href='https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#block-sequences'><span>dashes</span></a><span> are used to create “bulleted” </span><a href='https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#sequence'><span>lists</span></a><span>.</span></em></p><ul><li><span>YAML使用Unicode中的</span><a href='https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#character-set'><span>可打印字符</span></a><span>，其中</span><a href='https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#indicator-characters'><span>一部分</span></a><span>提供结构信息，其余包含数据本身。</span></li><li><span>YAML通过最小化结构字符的数量，从而实现整洁性与自然性。例如，</span><a href='https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#indentation-spaces'><span>缩紧</span></a><span>可以用于结构，</span><a href='https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#flow-mappings'><span>冒号</span></a><span>分隔</span><a href='https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#mapping'><span>键/值对</span></a><span>和</span><a href='https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#block-sequences'><span>破折号</span></a><span>用于创建&quot;项目符号&quot;</span><a href='https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#sequence'><span>列表</span></a><span>。</span></li></ul><p><em><span>There are many kinds of </span><a href='https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#dump'><span>data structures</span></a><span>, but they can all be adequately </span><a href='https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#representation-graph'><span>represented</span></a><span> with three basic primitives: </span><a href='https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#mapping'><span>mappings</span></a><span> (hashes/dictionaries), </span><a href='https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#sequence'><span>sequences</span></a><span> (arrays/lists) and </span><a href='https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#scalars'><span>scalars</span></a><span> (strings/numbers). YAML leverages these primitives and adds a simple typing system and </span><a href='https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#anchors-and-aliases'><span>aliasing</span></a><span> mechanism to form a complete language for </span><a href='https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#serializing-the-representation-graph'><span>serializing</span></a><span> any </span><a href='https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#representing-native-data-structures'><span>native data structure</span></a><span>. While most programming languages can use YAML for data serialization, YAML excels in working with those languages that are fundamentally built around the three basic primitives. These include common dynamic languages such as JavaScript, Perl, PHP, Python and Ruby.</span></em></p><p><em><span>There are hundreds of different languages for programming, but only a handful of languages for storing and transferring data. Even though its potential is virtually boundless, YAML was specifically created to work well for common use cases such as: configuration files, log files, interprocess messaging, cross-language data sharing, object persistence and debugging of complex data structures. When data is easy to view and understand, programming becomes a simpler task.</span></em></p><ul><li><span>可通过三种基本的原语，</span><a href='https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#mapping'><span>mappings</span></a><span>(哈希值/字典)，</span><a href='https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#sequence'><span>sequence</span></a><span>(数组/列表)和</span><a href='https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#scalars'><span>标量</span></a><span>(字符串/数字)，</span><a href='https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#representation-graph'><span>表示</span></a><span>许多种</span><a href='https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#dump'><span>数据结构</span></a><span>。</span></li><li><span>YAML利用了这些原语，并添加了一个简单的类型系统和</span><a href='https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#anchors-and-aliases'><span>别名</span></a><span>机制，以形成一个完整的语言，用于</span><a href='https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#serializing-the-representation-graph'><span>序列化</span></a><span>任何</span><a href='https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#representing-native-data-structures'><span>原生数据结构</span></a><span>。</span></li><li><span>虽然大多数编程语言都可以使用YAML进行数据序列化，但YAML擅长处理那些基本上围绕三个基本原语构建的语言。这些语言包括常见的动态语言，如JavaScript、Perl、PHP、Python和Ruby。</span></li><li><span>YAML常见功能举例：配置文件、日志文件、进程间消息传递、跨语言数据共享、对象持久性和复杂数据结构的调试。</span></li></ul><h2 id='11-goals'><span>1.1.

YAML History</span></h2><p><em><span>The YAML 1.0 specification was published in early 2004 by by Clark Evans, Oren Ben-Kiki, and Ingy döt Net after 3 years of collaborative design work through the yaml-core mailing list</span><a href='https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#fn:yaml-core'><span>5</span></a><span>. The project was initially rooted in Clark and Oren’s work on the SML-DEV</span><a href='https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#fn:sml-dev'><span>6</span></a><span> mailing list (for simplifying XML) and Ingy’s plain text serialization module</span><a href='https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#fn:denter'><span>7</span></a><span> for Perl. The language took a lot of inspiration from many other technologies and formats that preceded it.</span></em></p><p><em><span>The first YAML framework was written in Perl in 2001 and Ruby was the first language to ship a YAML framework as part of its core language distribution in 2003.</span></em></p><p><em><span>The YAML 1.1</span><a href='https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#fn:1-1-spec'><span>8</span></a><span> specification was published in 2005. Around this time, the developers became aware of JSON</span><a href='https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#fn:json'><span>9</span></a><span>. By sheer coincidence, JSON was almost a complete subset of YAML (both syntactically and semantically).</span></em></p><p><em><span>In 2006, Kyrylo Simonov produced PyYAML</span><a href='https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#fn:pyyaml'><span>10</span></a><span> and LibYAML</span><a href='https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#fn:libyaml'><span>11</span></a><span>. A lot of the YAML frameworks in various programming languages are built over LibYAML and many others have looked to PyYAML as a solid reference for their implementations.</span></em></p><p><em><span>The YAML 1.2</span><a href='https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#fn:1-2-spec'><span>3</span></a><span> specification was published in 2009. Its primary focus was making YAML a strict superset of JSON. It also removed many of the problematic implicit typing recommendations.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Since the release of the 1.2 specification, YAML adoption has continued to grow, and many large-scale projects use it as their primary interface language. In 2020, the new </span><a href='https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/ext/team'><span>YAML language design team</span></a><span> began meeting regularly to discuss improvements to the YAML language and specification; to better meet the needs and expectations of its users and use cases.</span></em></p><p><em><span>This YAML 1.2.2 specification, published in October 2021, is the first step in YAML’s rejuvenated development journey. YAML is now more popular than it has ever been, but there is a long list of things that need to be addressed for it to reach its full potential. The YAML design team is focused on making YAML as good as possible.</span></em></p><h2 id='13-terminology'><span>1.3.
